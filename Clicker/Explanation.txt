	Just like the title of the folder says, it is a clicker game, just without the scaling that usually comes along with it.
	In this game you just click on the circle and you get an amount of points. You can click on one of the buttons(they are not
classes because i had not learned them at that time so i had to do without them) which if you have more than the number in the middle you will buy the upgrade and for every 10 points spent you will get 1 more point/click.
	After buying an upgrade 9 times, the upgrade will run out of stock and you will not be able to buy it.
